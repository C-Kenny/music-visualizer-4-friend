# Music Visualizer 4 Friend

### What?
Music Visualizer, starting with a 2D representation. Written in Processing. [Main Processing file](/code/halo_3_emblem/halo_3_emblem/halo_3_emblem.pde)

The repo also holds my learnings of Processing and graphics, for historical sake.

### Current State?

### Why?

One of my friends passed away, we used to play a lot of Halo together. This music visualizer is dedicated to him, and we use his Halo 3 Emblem as inspiration.
